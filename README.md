# SURVIV-OS: Post-Apocalyptic Security Training Simulator

## 🎮 Overview

SURVIV-OS is an interactive cybersecurity training game set in a post-apocalyptic world where radiation, survival, and hacking skills determine your fate. Your mobile device is both your lifeline and your weapon in a world where digital and physical threats merge.

In this harsh new reality, you must defend your device from AI-driven attacks while scavenging for digital resources, decoding encrypted survival data, and hacking into abandoned systems. The game transforms complex security concepts into survival necessities - where knowing the correct radiation protocol or binary sequence could mean the difference between life and death.

Unlike traditional security training, SURVIV-OS uses intuitive drag-and-drop mechanics, visual programming, and survival-themed puzzles to teach complex concepts without requiring extensive technical knowledge.
